# Mapping_Earthquakes
Create interactive map using Javascript, Leaflet, and D3

# Project Overview:
The purpose of this project was to build interactive data visualizations for the Disaster Reporting Network that show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days, earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.


# Results:
This image shows the site as it initially loads. The upper right corner shows the menu to navigate between maps and overlays. The lower right corner shows a map legend for the earthquake magnitude. The legend was updated to include magnitude 6 or higher earthquakes to show what the darker color in Major Earthquakes symbolizes.

This image shows the map with only the new additions. This includes overlays for Tectonic Plates and Major Earthquakes, a dark map style, and marker popups that display magnitude and location of the earthquakes.

# Summary: 
The map displays earthquake magnitude and location using colored circular markers. Users can toggle between map styles and overlays to customize the map for their needs.
